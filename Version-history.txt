 their are saved with.

-Added admin menu to load saved buildings. To stay server-
 side, this menu is listed under "Change the Mission", as
 " - Load Building File - " game type. File menu will list
 last 10 auto-saved files provided they are in an unbroken
 sequence from 0 and up, and also any "*.cs" files stored
 under "Buildings/Admin/*".

-Changed shape of Telepad and reworked Telepad code. Added

 upside-down by hand or redeploying them.

-Generator and Solar Panel objects now show their power
 frequency and switch state when looked at.

 without power. This is intended as an aid in removing spam.
 Generator and Solar Panel objects are listed in Commander Hud,
 and any other deployables can be removed with this function.

 Note that this function only removes objects outside the
 "power zone" of any power object. No checks for power frequency
 or team is made. It is intended as a tool to remove spam
 outside "populated" areas only.

-Added Power Panagement mode to Construction Tool. Also fixed
 timing issues with the different Tool modes.

-Added power frequencies for generators and powered objects.
 Power frequency is set by either using beacon key before

 will use that frequency until power frequency is changed,
 or player dies.

 instead of 200 minutes.

 emitter.

 instantly after being deployed if there is no power
 source available. Already deployed fields will power
 down, but not disappear, if they lose power.

-Added new Generator and Solar Panel packs. Force Field,
 Gravity Field, Large Inventory Station and shielded
 objects now require power to operate. Generator powers
 items within a 100 meter radius. Solar Panel powers items
 within a 50 meter radius.

 Deployable Generator and Solar Panel do not power normal
 base objects, and normal base generators do not power
 deployables.

 When a Force Field or Gravity Field is damaged, it will absorb
 25 percent of the damage and evenly distribute the remaining
 75 percent among Generator and Solar Panel units that power it,
 draining shields and causing damage.

-Tree pack can now be deployed close to another Tree, or on
 another Tree. Most deployables can be deployed on it. The same
 goes for Crate pack as well.

 deconstruction failed.

 normally, without exploding them.

 force field.

-Added new Force Field pack with deconstructible force
 field pad.

 Force Field pack has 21 modes:

 by the game engine.

 deploying at extremely weird angles when deployed
 on other funky Light Support Beams.

-Loaded Medium Support Beams now no longer take down all
 the deployables in the mission when they are destroyed.

 Construction server.

-Added nerf guns, with optional dance/death anims and
 optional jail mode. 'Paintball' games!

-Added nerf gun options to admin menu.

-Added Super Chaingun, for demolition work. Only available
 to admins. Automatically given at use of inventory station.
 It may cause a bit of lag on large structures; use in bursts.

-Plascannon now does double damage in blast radius. Added direct-
 hit damage similar to mortar blast. Easier removal of spam,
 without the randomness of the mortar.

-Chaingun now does x4 damage, and has a tighter spread cone.
 Easier pin-point removal of spammy items, especially mid-air
 pieces.

 Note that the above weapon changes may go away if enough people
 complain. If you host your own server, you can remove the changes
 by deleting "plasma.cs" and "chaingun.cs" from your
 "Construction\scripts\weapons" folder.

-Added prison feature, for auto-punishing TK's and deployables
 spammers, and to let admins deal with troublemakers without
 kicking them. Handy for damage control when a n00b joins the game,
 and you want him/her somewhere safe and not blowing up stuff while
 you explain the point of the mod.

 Currently, non-auto prison is only available through console:
 jailPlayer(clientId,release[1/0],time);

 Settings are saved with "prefs/ServerPrefs.cs" - no need to change
 "prison.cs".

-Added prison option to admin menu.
 Note that if prison is added mid-mission, it will not be
 lit (no lighting).

-Admins can rain down a hail of fire on naughty players.
 This can be very laggy if buildings are involved. Only
 available through console (must be host), for now.
 Type "JTLMeteorStrike();" in console for help, or see the
 script file.
