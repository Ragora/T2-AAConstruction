The BASIC IDEA:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We just like to build stuff.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to now mods like ninja mod and warped where used to create the wierdest of structures. 
However these mods being combat orientated where limited in their building flexiblity.
Therefor the man with the vision started "the construction mod" (or is it the mod named "construction"?)
Anyway this mod will feature tools to make building easier, better, more realistic, more balanced and all that what other modders promise.
It might someday very well feature gameplay that suits builders as well as non-builders.
However until that day this mod remains for the one intrested in building and only building.
But hey, there's a builder in everyone.

*******************Features******************

[[Beacon switching]]
-Some packs have more than one function.

****************Current deployables*********** 

[[Light support beam]]<<Light armor>>
-Comes in 5 basic lengths 1.5 meter, 4 meter, 8 meter, 40 meter and 160 meter.
-Has two smart functions 
	+auto-size, will scales the beam between 0.5 and 16 meter, if not confined it will scale to 4 meters.
        +Pad, Sizes like the auto-size beam, but also streches to create a platform.
           
[[Light Blast Wall]]<<Light armor>>
-Works like the padsetting of the light support beam.
-User can specify if he's in or out side his building for deploy adjustments
-Light Blast walls can now create an good defence for buildings.

Problems: Placing stuff on them doesn't not work 100%

[[Light Walk Way]]<<Light armor>>
-Just face the edge of a cliff and deploy to create handy walkways.
-Can be set to slope 0%, 20%, 45% and 90% up and down.
-Use the beacons to switch modes.

[[Medium support Beam]]<<Medium armor>>
-Much stronger than it's light counter part.
-Doesn't adjust in lenght.
-Comes with rings you can deploy on, and stand on to easaly deploy another medium spine ontop.
-The rings can be removed sperately.

[[Medium Floor]]<<Medium armor>>
-Deploy these for a good start.
-Deploy floors on floors to create an adjectand floor at the closest edge your deploying on.
        
[[Jumpad]]<<Medium armor>>
-Launch the player up some distance.

[[Telleporter]]<<Heavy armor>>
-40 different telle port frequencies.
-Will only telle port to the frequency it's set to.
-Both teams use the same 40 frequencies.
-Dangerous side effects that become worse when the telleport is damaged.

[[Energizers]]<<Heavy armor>>

[[Deployable base turret]]<<Heavy armor>>
-Deploy these for extra protection.

[[Deployable tree]]<<Medium/Heavy armors>>
-Make places look nicer with these things.

Problems: Deploying on them will be screwed up.

[[Deconsruct Gun]]<<all armors>>
-If you make an mistake you can correct it with this with out any dangerous side effects.
-Make sure you remove mistakes right after you made them.
